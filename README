This is a work in early progress. For more information please join #perl6 on

State:

    The parser is pretty complete, if you find anything that it should
    parse and doesn't, or the other way round, please let me know.
    
    The action methods are bit buggy.
    Currently string escape sequences of the form \uFFFF make it die, and
    [{ a => b}] is reproduced as [ a => b].
